The analyze_opts.py tool is used to find options which appear in
/etc/nova/nova.conf but not in etc/nova/nova.conf.sample
This helps identify options in the nova.conf file which are not used by nova.
The tool also identifies any options which are set to the default value.

Run it from the top-level working directory i.e.

  $> ./tools/config/analyze_opts.py
