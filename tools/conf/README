This tool is used to generate etc/nova/nova.conf.sample

Run it from the top-level working directory i.e.

  $> ./tools/conf/generate_sample.sh

Watch out for warnings about modules like libvirt, qpid and zmq not
being found - these warnings are significant because they result
in options not appearing in the generated config file.
